# Alex Cobb
I have taught English and English as a second language at UC and Xavier off and on for a few years. I also do freelance copywriting and editing in the retail, e-learning, and PR sectors and own and operate an independent record label. 
I hope to gain the skills needed to be gainfully employed in the development industry and potentially identify areas in which I want to specialize. 
I'd like to write code.
